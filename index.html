            <p class="our-story-text-p4">
                We met in 2018 while working together on the same engineering team at Centene in St. Louis, MO. 
                Spencer had a crush on me from the day that he started, but I had no idea. I found out about 
                this crush about 6 months later while we were walking to our cars together one afternoon. He said 
                that it would be cool if we went out sometime after work. I thought he meant as a team, so I 
                mentioned how I thought it would be great for our team to bond outside of work. However, what he 
                actually was trying to get was a date. I could tell by his body language that he didn’t mean what 
                I had thought and as soon as I got into my car I felt terrible! Later on, I told him that I would 
                love to hang out with him sometime. We went on an official date a couple of days later and ended 
                up staying up until 3am the next day. I think we both knew at that moment that we had something 
                really special.

            <p class="our-story-text-p4">
                Through the years that we have been together, we have moved from 
                St. Louis, MO to Denver, CO and then finally to Huntsville, AL where we have decided to call 
                home. It has been an incredible journey and we are so excited to get married in June!
